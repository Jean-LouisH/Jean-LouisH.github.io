# Applications and Libraries

## [Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/blob/master/README.md)

![Screenshot](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/blob/master/Documentation/Images/Screenshot.gif)

[Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania) is **a hobbyist and experimental 2D/3D engine for real-time simulations and games**. 

It is being developed as a personal exercise in applying my learning outcomes from university and reading. I also intend to use it as a testbed for small real-time simulations, scientific visualizations, artificial intelligence algorithms and games.

For the sake of learning, select portions of the engine will be made from my own code rather than existing solutions. My learning objectives include; 
* [Scene Architecture & Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph); 
* [Cache Locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference) Optimizations;
* [Multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Multithreading); 
* [Profiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)); 
* [Physics, Collision Detection & Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection); 
* [Audio Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine#Audio_engine); 
* [Real-Time Rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computer_graphics); 
* APIs such as [Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)](https://www.libsdl.org/), [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) and [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec33.core.pdf).

among others.

## [Libretti](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/README.md)

![Screenshot](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/Screenshot.gif)

[Libretti](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti) is **a synthesizer library for integration with applications and games**.

It can compile audio data from text files that are written with [Libretti's scripting language](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/Documentation/Scripting%20Language%20Specification.txt)

## [Suprannua Engine](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/blob/master/README.md)

![Screenshot](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/blob/master/Documentation/Images/Screenshot.gif)

Suprannua Engine is a superannuated, 2D platformer game engine codebase. It was my first extensive project I've ever undertaken independently - when I was a freshman at university. It was also my first time using third party software libraries. At that time I only knew C and I had a very basic understanding of programming in general, so I used it improve my skills. 

You can [download all the games and tests I've made with Suprannua Engine here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/releases/download/v0.14.0-alpha/Suprannua.0.14.0.Games.Tests.zip). All movement is done through WASD keys where not specified. 

This repository is abandoned, discontinued and archived. It is limited in functionality, ease of use and scalability. All code is run procedurally and designed back then with my limited knowledge of data structures, [event systems](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/blob/master/SuprannuaEngine/Events.c), memory allocation and so on.

## [Lilliputian](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lilliputian/blob/master/README.md)

[Lilliputian](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lilliputian) is **a tiny 2D game engine library** in which a complete engine link library is provided for the user to create small 2D games. This is achieved by updating game scene trees with a `Lilliputian::Editor` object and writing C++ game scripts with a `Lilliputian::ScriptingAPI` object. 

It is being developed to replace the archived and unstable [Suprannua Engine](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SuprannuaEngine/blob/master/README.md) framework without being as large and aimless as the experimental [Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/blob/master/README.md) application. To achieve this, it will reuse code from my [SDL Sub-Engines](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/SDLSubEngines), [Libretti](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti/blob/master/README.md) and [Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania/blob/master/README.md) repositories. 

This also started as a practical scenario to learn how to use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) through CMakeLists and to use unit testing frameworks like Google Test.

## [ElecCirSim](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/ElecCirSim/blob/master/README.md)

ElecCirSim is a real-time analogue and digital [circuit simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit_simulation). 

## [guiSyrup](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/guiSyrup/blob/master/README.md)

guiSyrup is a C++ graphical user interface library, accelerated by [OpenGL 3.3](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec33.core.pdf).
