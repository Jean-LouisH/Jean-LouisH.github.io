These are Developed as I Progress with Learning Materials and Tutorials or by Random Prototypes to Test Concepts Before Implementing Them in Other Projects.

## [LeetCode](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/LeetCode)

## [Algorithms, Data Structures](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Algorithms-DataStructures)

Implementing and Studying Algorithms Taught in the "CLRS" Introduction to Algorithms Book, using Python. 

## [Image Processing Algorithms](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/ImageProcessingAlgorithms)

Implementing and Studying Image Algorithms using Python with Pillow

## [Learn OpenGL](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/LearnOpenGL)

## [Iteration Speed Experiment](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/IterationSpeedExperiment)

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jean-LouisH/IterationSpeedExperiment/master/Screenshot.png)

This is a quick comparison of execution speeds when applying the same iterative operation on different data structures representing a collection of 2x1 vectors. This is to investigate the impact of data access methods on execution speed within a compiled C++ release binary, such as in being able to leveraging efficient CPU and memory use.

## [EM Raytracing Model](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/EMRayTracingModel) 

A Python Ray Tracer for Electromagnetic Radiation (3 Î¼m - 300 nm) Interaction with Objects of Differing Characteristics.

## [Memristor ReRAM Model](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/MemristorReRAMModel)

A Python Simulation Model of a Memristor used as a Single Bit Storage in ReRAM.

## [Perceptron Model](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/PerceptronModel)
