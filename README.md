Lania is a 2D & 3D real-time simulation and game engine. It is being developed as a personal exercise in applying my learning outcomes from university and reading. I also intend to have it as a modifiable codebase for my own future real-time applications like simulation software, and possibly to eventually use it as an in-house lightweight alternative to other engines for my game projects.

My learning objectives include; scene architecture & management; scripting, interpreters & programming language development; file parsing & formatting; cache locality optimizations; multithreading; data structures; profiling; physics & collision algorithms; audio programming; rendering; and APIs such as Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL),PortAudio and Vulkan.

This software is free, and open source. You can find the software repository [here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania).

Libretti is a core synthesizer library for integration with applications and games. It reads and writes its own binary file format for audio data, but it can also compile that data from text files that are written with Libretti's scripting language

This software is free, open source and MIT Licenced. You can find the software repository [here](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Libretti).
