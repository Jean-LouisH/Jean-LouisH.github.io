Lania is a 2D/3D engine for real-time simulations and games. It is being developed as a personal exercise in applying my learning outcomes from university and reading. I also intend to use it as a testbed for small real-time simulations, scientific visualizations, artificial intelligence algorithms and games.

My learning objectives include; scene architecture & management; file parsing & formatting; cache locality optimizations; multithreading; data structures; profiling; physics & collision algorithms; audio programming; rendering; and APIs such as Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), PortAudio, OpenGL and Vulkan.
